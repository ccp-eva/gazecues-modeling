# Introduction
- why do we care about developmental trajectory? ref to stat learning paper
- variation 

# Lifespan 
- development & individual differences in gaze understanding
- verweis methods paper reliable differences kinder & adults. 
- kontinuerliche, systematische variation, wodrin? => model

# Computational cognitive model
- model auch für warum ältere Erwachsene schlecht? anders schlecht als kinder?
- entwicklungsperspektive basierend auf model
- dann prozess-ebene => magnet

# Non-social vector following

## Analysis
All test trials without voice-over descriptions were included in our analyses.
We ran all analyses in `r R.version$version.string` [@rcoreteam2022language].
Regression models were fit as Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with default priors for all analyses, using the function `brm` from the package `brms` [@burkner2017brms; @burkner2018advanced].
