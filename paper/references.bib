  abstract = {Children of 4{$\frac{1}{2}$}, 5, and 5{$\frac{1}{2}$} years of age were tested for their knowledge of 3 spatial perspective-taking rules: (1) any object will appear the same to the self and another person if both view it from the same position; (2) a heterogeneous-sided object (in this study, a tangle of wire) will appear different to the 2 observers if they view it from different sides; and (3) a homogeneous-sided object (a cylinder) will appear the same to the 2 if they view it from different sides. The data suggested that at least rules 1 and 2 undergo development during this age period and that 5{$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-olds have a good grasp of all 3 rules. There was no evidence that the 3 rules differed in difficulty or age of acquisition.},

Study 1 replicated and further validated a finding by Z. S. Masangkay et al (see record 1977-02937-001) that 3-yr-olds perform very well on tasks that call for Level 1 knowledge but very poorly on those that require Level 2 knowledge. Study 2 showed that Ss did not perform better when critical aspects of Level 2 tasks were designed to be familiar to them and similar to what they might encounter in everyday life. Study 3 showed that most of the Ss who performed poorly on Level 2 tasks in Study 2 continued to perform poorly on a retest given 2\textendash 19 wks later. In addition, a brief training period following the retest proved largely unsuccessful in inducing Level 2 knowledge and thinking in these children. Results of the studies appear to provide strong support for the Level 1\textendash Level 2 developmental hypothesis. (12 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here we present TANGO (Task for Assessing iNdividual differences in Gaze understanding - Open); a brief (approx. 5\textendash 10min), reliable, open-source task to quantify individual differences in the understanding of gaze cues. Our interactive browser-based task works across devices and enables in-person and remote testing. The implemented spatial layout allows for discrete and continuous measures of participants' click imprecision and is easily adaptable to different study requirements. Our task measures inter-individual differences in a child (N = 387) and an adult (N = 236) sample. Our two study versions and data collection modes yield comparable results that show substantial developmental gains: the older children are, the more accurately they locate the target. High internal consistency and test\textendash retest reliability estimates underline that the captured variation is systematic. This work shows a promising way forward in studying individual differences in social cognition and will help us explore the structure and development of our core social-cognitive processes in greater detail.},

  abstract = {Discussions about the replicability of psychological studies have primarily focused on improving research methods and practices, with less attention paid to the role of well-specified theories in facilitating the production of reliable empirical results. The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology\textemdash what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.},

  abstract = {Abstract\textemdash{} All sciences use models of some variety to understand complex phenomena. In developmental science, however, modeling is mostly limited to linear, algebraic descriptions of behavioral data. Some researchers have suggested that complex mathematical models of developmental phenomena are a viable (even necessary) tool that provide fertile ground for developing and testing theory as well as for generating new hypotheses and predictions. This article explores the concerns, attitudes, and historical trends that underlie the tension between two cultures: one in which computational simulations of behavior are an important complement to observation and experimentation and another that emphasizes evidence from behavioral experiments and linear models enhanced by verbal descriptions. This tension is explored as a dialogue among three characters: Ed (Experimental Developmentalist), Mira (Modeling Inclusive Research Advocate), and Phil (Philosopher of Science).},
