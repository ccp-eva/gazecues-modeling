\subsubsection{Model structures}\label{model-structures}}

In the paper, we reported the following model structures: linear model: \texttt{mean\_imprecision\ \textasciitilde{}\ age\_centered}; quadratic model in \texttt{R:\ mean\_imprecision\ \textasciitilde{}\ 1\ +\ age\_centered\ +\ I(age\_centered\^{}2)}; cubic model: \texttt{mean\_imprecision\ \textasciitilde{}\ 1\ +\ age\_centered\ +\ I(age\_centered\^{}2)\ +\ I(age\_centered\^{}3);} Gaussian process model: \texttt{mean\_imprecision\ \textasciitilde{}\ gp(age\_centered,\ k=50,\ c=5/4,\ scale=TRUE)}. Note the additional parameters in the Gaussian process model. With the default settings, the underlying Gaussian process maths would get solved exactly. By providing the arguments \texttt{k} and \texttt{c}, we use an approximation process. The higher the value of k, the better the approximation: we have used \texttt{k=50} for faster processing speed and better diagnostics. \texttt{brms} suggests 5/4 as a value for \texttt{c}. Adding \texttt{scale=TRUE} is supposed to improve sampling speed and convergence.

Originally, we fitted the models on a trial-by-trial basis with the following structure in \texttt{R:\ performance\ \textasciitilde{}\ age\ +\ symmetricPosition\ +\ trialNr\ +\ (1\ +\ symmetricPosition\ +\ trialNr\ \textbar{}\ subjID)}. However, the Gaussian Process model was computationally heavy. Therefore, we simplified the model structure, aggregated data on a subject level, and included only age as an effect. We then visually compared the model predictions of the original and the simplified models with each other. As you can see in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}, results of the two models did not differ notably.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{changepoint-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Changepoint analysis}\label{changepoint-analysis}}

In our Bayesian changepoint analysis, we restricted the model to a constant mean (i.e., a flat line with zero degree polynomial) within each segment, and to have minimally 10 data points between two change points (i.e., corresponding to half of the data points we collected per adult decade) to avoid ``overreactions'' to individual outlying data points. In a supplementary analysis, we assessed how different parameter settings effected of our changepoint analysis. We changed the number of allowed change points, the minimum number of data points between change points, and the polynomial order. When the model had more explorative room, for example, by a greater number of change points, smaller minimum number of data points between change points, higher polynomial order, the model outputs showed more fine-grained change points. The exact location of the change points varied slightly. Overall, the interpretation stayed the same as the one we reported in the paper. While early childhood was characterized by much change, adults showed a relatively stable level of imprecision. There was a minor change in that elderly adults became slightly more imprecise again. If you are interested into the details, please have a look at the file \texttt{supplements\_changepoint\_parameters.html}, which you can find in the GitHub repository in the \texttt{stats} folder.

\hypertarget{gaze-model-prediction}{%
\subsubsection{Gaze model prediction}\label{gaze-model-prediction}}

Our gaze model predicts that TANGO trials vary in their difficulty, resulting in a U-shaped pattern: Participants' imprecision should increase, the further out the target lands (towards the very left/right sides). Since the task is presented on a screen, there is a natural border towards one side. Imagine the target lands to the very right side. Participants' imprecision cannot click further right because the screen ends; all their uncertainty about the target location faces the inner, left-hand side now. Therefore, the predicted U-shaped pattern should decrease again towards the screen borders. For previous reliability analyses (Prein, Kalinke, Haun, \& Bohn, 2023), we had increased the trial number for an adult sample (N = 70; each 30 trials). Interestingly, here we found the expected shape in the data: the U-pattern decreased again towards the screen ends (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}).

\subsection{Inference parameter estimates per individual}\label{inference-parameter-estimates-per-individual}}

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:fig3} and Figure \ref{fig:fig4}, the gaze model estimated the inference parameter for each individual. Across individuals, the inference parameter varied in the estimated magnitude and level of uncertainty. In general, estimates for more precise individuals (i.e., smaller inference parameter value) showed decreased levels of uncertainty.

This is the \emph{own-belief} question., If the child chooses the bushes: ``Well, that's a good idea, but Linda thinks her cat is in the garage. She thinks her cat is in the garage.'' (or vice versa) Then the child is asked the \emph{target} question: ``So where will Linda look for her cat? in the bushes or in the garage?'', To be correct, the child must answer the target question opposite from his/her answer to the \emph{own-belief} question. & Toy figure of girl, Sheet of paper with bushes and a garage (e.g., garden) \\

\hypertarget{animal-vs.-human-faces}{%
\subsubsection{Animal vs.~human faces}\label{animal-vs.-human-faces}}

In Study 1 and Study 2, we presented the TANGO (Prein et al., 2023) with animal characters. For Study 3, we exchanged the animals with human faces, modelled in appearance after the local population. We decided to do so in order to enhance the social context of this task and to make it more comparable to the Theory of Mind task battery (where there is live interaction with the experimenter). To ensure the change from animal to human faces did not notably change children's responses, we conducted an exploratory analysis. We conducted a GLMM analysis with the following model structure in \texttt{R:\ click\ \textasciitilde{}\ age\_scaled\ +\ stimuli\ +\ symmetric\_position\ +\ trial\_nr\ +\ (1\ +\ symmetric\_position\ +\ trial\_nr\ \textbar{}\ subj\_id)}; where \texttt{stimuli} denoted either human or animal faces. The estimate for the fixed effect of \texttt{stimuli} was small and the 95\% CrI included zero: \(\beta\) = 0.16; 95\% CrI {[}-0.06; 0.37{]}). Therefore, we concluded that the animal vs.~human version of the TANGO did not differ substantially.

\hypertarget{model-comparisons}{%
\subsubsection{Model comparisons}\label{model-comparisons}}

To identify which (social-)cognitive components were needed to best explain the TANGO score, we compared GLMMs that predicted the mean imprecision in gaze understanding by age + the respective task score: imprecision in non-social vector estimation, the ToM aggregate score, and/ or the aggregate of the two perspective-taking tasks (subset of ToM battery). For example, the model notation in \texttt{R:\ tango\_mean\ \textasciitilde{}\ age\_centered\ +\ magnet\_scaled\ +\ perspective\_scaled}). The model including the non-social vector estimation task (magnet) and the two perspective-taking tasks won, as indicated by the model comparison results below.
